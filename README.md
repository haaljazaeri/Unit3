# Project 3 - *Flixster Pt. 2*

Submitted by: **Hassan AlJazaeri**

We will be continuing with *Flixster*. I have use Postman, a popular network debugging tool, and add the ability to fetch real data from a third party server! I have also learn collection views and tab bar controllers, both very common UI patterns found in apps. Collection views allow for more flexible UI layouts, and I have build a grid-like UI to view movies in a more visual manner..

Time spent: **5* hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [✔] Implement network call and table view to display a list of movies currently playing (title, description, image)
- [✔] App has a collection view with the same list of movies
- [✔] Uses a tab bar controller to switch between collection view and table view screens
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Make an additional network call to another end-point.	
- [ ] Allow users to scroll when context items are off-screen (table view implemention)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
